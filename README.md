# EasyCode

### What is EasyCode？

> EasyCode is a code generation plugin developed for IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, which mainly generates all kinds of code you want through custom templates (based on velocity). Usually used to generate Entity, Dao, Service, Controller. If you have strong hands-on ability, it can also be used to generate HTML, JS, PHP and other codes. In theory, any code related to database can be generated.
